# Interesting strings
## Portal
The client contains a large number of Portal and Portal 2 specific strings indicating Respawn used Portal 2's code as a base.
- `c:\\depot\\r1pcstaging\\src\\game\\client\\portal\\c_portal_player.cpp`
- `Toggle whether the player is funneled into portals while running on speed paint.`
- `c:\\depot\\r1pcstaging\\src\\game\\client\\portal2\\c_hitbox_damaged_entity.cpp`
- `#PORTAL2_Coop_YourPartnerInScience`
- etc.
- 
Granted, there is also some Half-Life stuff like `d3_citadel_05` but since Portal 2 was released later the base engine was more likeley to be from Portal2.

## Network messages
The client contains a number of Titanfall specific game state messages.
- `PLAYER_MELEE_STATE_TITAN_EXECUTION`
- `PLAYER_MELEE_STATE_TITAN_EXECUTION_PREDICTED`
- etc.
- `ACT_ZIPLINING`
- `ACT_RODEOED_CROUCHWALK`
- `ACT_TRAVERSE_ACROSS_1024_UP_256`
- etc.
